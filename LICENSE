# Ethical Preamble

This software is free. MIT License. No restrictions, no catches.

But freedom isn't the absence of responsibility — it's the presence of choice.

We built these tools with intention. They're meant to reduce toil, not replace judgment. To augment human capability, not surveil it. To make systems that learn *with* you, not *about* you.

When you build with this, we ask only that you consider:

- **Consent** — Does the user know? Did they agree?
- **Care** — Does this reduce suffering or add to it?
- **Coherence** — Does this make systems more understandable, or more opaque?

These aren't legal requirements. They're design questions. The answers are yours to live with.

If you use this to harm, manipulate, or exploit — the license won't stop you. But we'll know. And so will you.
